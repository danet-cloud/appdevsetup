Airtable usage

When to use Airtable (recommended criteria)
- Use Airtable when:
  - the data must be consumed by other apps/services easily,
  - you want a simple UI for viewing/editing/triaging,
  - it acts as a lightweight queue or tracking system.
- Keep the job local when:
  - it is a discrete one-off transformation,
  - data does not need multi-device access,
  - Airtable adds friction without benefit.

Schema hygiene
- Prefer stable IDs and explicit fields over implicit meanings.
- Store:
  - source file reference (path/URL),
  - processing status (queued/running/success/failed),
  - timestamps,
  - outputs (links/paths),
  - error details (short + actionable).

Integration patterns
- Batch reads/writes where possible.
- Avoid “chatty” row-by-row updates unless needed for UX.
- Keep Airtable as coordination/UI; keep heavy processing local on the Mac Studio.

Secrets
- Airtable keys live in environment variables, not in code or Airtable itself.
