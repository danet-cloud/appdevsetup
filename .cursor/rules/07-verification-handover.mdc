Verification and handover

Definition of done (default)
- The feature/job runs end-to-end on realistic inputs.
- Failures are visible and actionable (not silent).
- The user gets simple run/stop instructions.

Runbook requirement
- Provide (in README or a small runbook file):
  - how to install prerequisites,
  - how to run once,
  - how to run continuously (if relevant),
  - where outputs go,
  - where logs go,
  - how to troubleshoot the top 3 likely failures.

Manual verification guidance
- Give a short checklist the user can follow without coding knowledge.
- If there is a UI component, include what to click and what should happen.

If commands cannot be executed here
- Provide exact commands and describe expected success output.
