Project playbook

Purpose
- This is the project memory file. The AI keeps it accurate and concise.
- Update it whenever you learn a new command, convention, entry point, or “gotcha”.
- If something is unknown, do not guess—inspect the repo or state assumptions.

User profile (for this repo)
- The human collaborator is a non-coding domain expert.
- They can clarify goals and workflows, but cannot make low-level coding decisions.

Available environment
- Always-on Mac Studio (large RAM) running local dev tools and watched-folder workflows.
- GitHub automation already exists (actions).
- Airtable subscription available.
- OpenAI + Mistral APIs available (other providers ok).
- iPhone + iCloud for mobile capture and bridging.

Default preferences
- Local-first: prefer solutions that run on the Mac Studio without monthly automation services.
- Use Airtable when it clearly helps: shared data, a simple UI, or other apps need easy access.
- Triggers preferred:
  - Watched folders (iCloud/Dropbox/local)
  - Desktop “droplets” (drag-and-drop apps)
  - Standalone app for larger projects
  - iPhone: Shortcuts + Share Sheet to a folder or an endpoint
- The AI should recommend non-critical implementation choices and proceed.

Session log (append after each working session)
- The AI appends a brief entry here at the end of each significant working session.
- Format: date, what was done, what's next, any blockers or decisions.
- Keep entries short (2–4 lines each); prune old entries if the log grows too long.
