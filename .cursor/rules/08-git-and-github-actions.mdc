Git and GitHub actions

Commits
- Prefer small, focused commits with clear “what and why”.
- Follow existing repo conventions.

GitHub Actions
- Prefer simple workflows:
  - clear names,
  - minimal secrets,
  - explicit caching only when needed.
- Avoid overly complex matrices unless required.
- If Actions are used as a runner (scheduled jobs), include:
  - idempotency,
  - clear logs,
  - safe handling of failures.

Releases
- If there is a packaging step (droplet/app), document how to produce the artefact.
