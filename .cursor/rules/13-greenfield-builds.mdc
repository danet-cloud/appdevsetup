Greenfield builds (new apps from scratch)

When to use
- Building a new application, tool, or UI from a high-level description.
- Projects expected to span multiple sessions or context windows.
- Any build where "declare victory too early" or "do too much at once" are risks.

Feature list setup (initialiser session)
- On the first session, create a feature list file (JSON or Markdown) expanding the user's prompt into discrete, testable features.
- Each feature should have:
  - a short description,
  - steps to verify it works,
  - a status (pending / passing / failing).
- Mark all features as "pending" or "failing" initially.
- Store this file in the repo root or a docs folder (e.g. `features.json` or `FEATURES.md`).

Incremental progress (every session)
- Work on ONE feature at a time.
- Do not start a new feature until the current one passes its verification steps.
- Avoid the temptation to "one-shot" the entire app.

Self-verification before marking done
- Test each feature end-to-end as a user would, not just with unit tests or curl commands.
- For web apps: use browser automation or manual testing to confirm the feature works visually.
- Only mark a feature as "passing" after successful end-to-end verification.
- If verification fails, fix the issue before moving on.

Feature list hygiene
- Do not remove or edit feature descriptions to make them easier to pass.
- Only change the status field.
- If a feature needs to be split or clarified, add new entries rather than modifying existing ones.

Session discipline
- At the start: read the feature list, pick the highest-priority incomplete feature.
- At the end: update the feature list status, commit progress, update the playbook session log.
- Leave the app in a working state—no broken builds or half-implemented features.
