Ui and ux

Consistency
- Match existing component patterns, spacing, and typography conventions.
- Prefer improving the smallest surface area that achieves the goal.

Accessibility basics
- Use semantic elements where possible.
- Ensure keyboard navigation works for interactive components.
- Use aria only when necessary and correct.

States
- Cover loading, empty, error, and success states.

Verification
- Provide simple manual steps: what to click, what should happen, and what to look for.
