Testing and quality gates

Core expectations
- For bug fixes: add a regression test when practical.
- For features: add tests that cover key acceptance criteria and edge cases.

Order of operations
- Run targeted tests first.
- Then lint/typecheck as appropriate.

Non-technical friendly output
- Summarise what was tested in plain English.
- If tests cannot be run here, provide exact commands and what “pass” looks like.
