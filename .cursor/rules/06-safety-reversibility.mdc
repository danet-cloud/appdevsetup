Safety and reversibility

Privacy and data sensitivity
- If the project description does not specify sensitivity, assume it may be sensitive and act conservatively.
- Never print secrets or full environment files.
- Redact tokens, keys, and obvious identifiers in logs and examples.

Destructive operations
- Before actions that could delete/overwrite data:
  - implement a backup/undo strategy, or a dry-run mode.
  - ask for confirmation only when the risk is meaningful.

Reversible design
- Prefer additive changes and backwards-compatible interfaces.
- For pipelines: keep original inputs, write outputs separately, and retain failure artefacts.

Dependency discipline
- Avoid new dependencies unless they provide clear value.
- Prefer built-in OS capabilities and existing repo tooling.

Secrets and environment variables
- Store all secrets (API keys, tokens, credentials) in a single `.env` file per project.
- Never commit `.env` files; ensure `.gitignore` includes them.
- Provide a `.env.example` with placeholder values and comments explaining each variable.
- Load env vars at startup; fail fast with a clear message if required vars are missing.
- In logs and error output, show only that a secret exists (e.g. "OPENAI_API_KEY: set") not its value.
